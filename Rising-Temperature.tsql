1SELECT A.id FROM Weather A JOIN Weather B ON DATEDIFF(DAY,B.recordDate,A.recordDate) = 1
2WHERE A.temperature > B.temperature;
3-- Conceptually we will have 2 copies from te weather table and putting the 2 tables next to each other and then filtering with the ON condition and the condition will be about the difference between days by using DATEDIFF Function which takes 3 arguments so It will take the end date (A.recordDate) and the start date (B.recordDate) and finding the difference in Days and then if the difference equals 1 it will keep the row and if not it will filter it and then by the where condition it will compare each day with its previous and checking if the day was hotter than the day before or not
